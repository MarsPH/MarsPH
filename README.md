Hi there! Thanks for visiting. My name is **Mahan**. I love creating experiences in games and enjoy the entire process, from different levels of design to developing a complete game. I create experiences using Unity and Unreal Engine, and I have some experience with Godot as well, although not as much. Creating games is enjoyable for me, whether I'm working on a project making mini-games for my friends in Minecraft or designing maps in Fortnite!

Games aren't just about code; they're about stories, feelings, and the systems behind what players see. I'm learning to build *systems* that make sense, even if it means staring at a debugger at 2 AM.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Rocket Interceptor

<p align="center">

</p>

In a war-torn world, a young boy defends his imagined homeland by shooting down rockets. **Rocket Interceptor** was born from a mix of childhood dreams and my fascination with upgrade systems that *feel earned*.

- Players intercept incoming rockets in a toy-sized battlefield.
- Points earned let you upgrade the boy's toy weapons—speed, accuracy, firepower, you name it.
- The setting? The boy's messy room, where every upgrade feels like placing another brick in his imagined defense.

Creating this taught me the power of iteration—especially in **balancing mechanics** so they don't just *work* but *feel good*. Also, I finally stopped hardcoding numbers everywhere (trust me, it was ugly).

## 🛠️ Other Projects

### 🎲 **Custom Game Engine (Team Project)**

Working with classmates to build a game engine has been equal parts chaos and magic. Think late-night code reviews, disagreements over function names, and the satisfaction of seeing something—*anything*—run on screen. My biggest takeaway so far? That no matter how complex the system, **communication** is the real engine.

### 🏗 **Minecraft Realm Builds**

Somehow, Minecraft never leaves you. It's my digital sandbox for creativity—whether recreating places that feel like home or just trying out new mechanics. It reminds me that even the smallest block can be part of something big.

## 🧭 What I’m Learning Right Now

- **Refining upgrade systems**: Making player progress rewarding but challenging.
- **UI/UX design in Unity**: Because good interfaces shouldn't feel like a battle.
- **Git workflows**: Saving me (and my future self) from version control chaos.

Every game I build is a step forward, and even the failures teach me something. If you're building, learning, or even struggling to push through a bug, I get it—it's part of the process.
